**🇦🇹 This project only works with the Austrian eGovernment platform. 🇦🇹**

PDF-Over is a PDF signing tool for power users. It offers a seamless native experience, and aims to minimize the effort required to sign large numbers of documents.

It allows automated signature positioning using [🇦🇹 signature placeholders](https://pdf.egiz.gv.at/pdf-as-wai/qrCodeGeneration), and supports all possible authentication factors for the ID-Austria platform. (SMSTan, App-QR, App-Biometry, and FIDO2 L2 certified security tokens.)

PDF-Over runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS (separate Intel and Apple Silicon bundles are available.) The latest release downloads can always be found at [technology.a-sit.at](https://technology.a-sit.at/en/pdf-over/).

- Inquiries and bug reports are accepted via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/a-sit/pdf-over/issues), or directed to [software@egiz.gv.at](mailto:software@egiz.gv.at).


### Data Protection Statement

The software PDF-Over processes the data required for the signature process locally on the installed device. 
The signature process with the citizen card is carried out locally. 

During the signature process using ID Austria, the PDF document to be signed is sent to the company A-Trust. 
The storage period and further data protection information for signatures using ID Austria can be found in the [data protection declaration of A-Trust](https://www.a-trust.at/downloads/documents/datenschutzerklaerung.pdf) at.
