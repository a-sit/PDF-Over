**RELEASE PREPARATION (versioning)**
* ensure that the bundled JRE is a recent version
  (this creates a release tag which has versioning fields set appropriately, tags it, and pushes it to github)
* switch to your pdf-over clone
* run ```mvn install``` to verify that it builds
  (you can skip this step if you are feeling brave)
* if using WSL, ensure that your line endings are correct: 
  ```git add --renormalize .```
* to actually prep a release, run ```mvn release:prepare -Dresume=false```
  (TEMPORARILY disable branch protection on the github repo before you do this)
* this will prompt in the following order:
  - current release version (x.y.z)
  - current release tag (we typically use pdf-over-x.y.z)
  - new snapshot version (new version with -SNAPSHOT suffix)
* afterwards it will update version to release version - commit this, tag it with your release tag, update version to new snapshot version and also commit this
* to build an installer, make sure you manually check out the release tag afterwards, before you proceed!

  **RE-ENABLE branch protection on the github repo before you proceed!**

**INSTALLER CREATION**

You can do this at any time if you want to test a finalized bundle, you don't need to do it on a release tag, it's independent from the previous section.
DO THIS ON LINUX! There are some weird quirks on other platforms, cf. issue #62 (if you are on windows, setup WSL, it works perfectly fine there)

  ```./release-instructions/publish.sh -Dks-pass={keystore password} -Dks-file={path to jks keystore file}```

if you only want specific binaries, use ```./release-instructions/publish.sh --profiles {windows|linux|mac} {remaining cli arguments as above}```
(you do not need to specify keystore parameters if testing, this will produce unsigned jars)

This produces pdf-over-build/pdf-over_{windows|linux|mac}-{x86_64|aarch64}.{zip|jar|tar.gz} files.

Each platform setup has to be post-processed specifically, see respective section(s) below.

---
**LINUX-SPECIFIC RELEASE PROCESS**

nothing to do here, just rename pdf-over_linux-x86_64.jar to PDF-Over-{version}.jar and call it a day

---
**WINDOWS-SPECIFIC RELEASE PROCESS**

**step 1: unpack zip archive**
  * unpack to a temp directory, e.g. *C:/temp/pdfover-packaging*
  * check if it runs
  * try if pdf-over.exe works

**step 2: create signed installer**
  * open PDF-Over.aip in Advanced Installer
  * update Product Details
    - Product version
    - attempt to switch away from page
    - when prompted, choose "Major Upgrade"
  * make sure the project is still valid (these *should* be correct, but...)
    - ensure that current files are included (Files and Folders)
      - include exactly the contents of the release zip except PDF-Over.aip
    - create shortcuts in "Start Menu -> Programs", "Desktop", and "Send To"
    - ensure Digital Signature configuration is correct
      - Use the A-SIT code signing cert from your cert store
      - We currently use http://timestamp.digicert.com for timestamping
      - SHA256 digest (or other appropriate choice)
    - ensure that Launch Conditions excludes 32-bit systems
    - ensure that the correct registry keys are setup (they already should be):

      KEY                                                                TYPE     NAME              DATA
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.pdf\OpenWithProgids]                           REG_SZ   PDF-Over.pdf      ""
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\PDF-Over.exe]                      REG_SZ   FriendlyAppName   PDF-Over
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\PDF-Over.exe\DefaultIcon]          REG_SZ   ""                "C:\Path\To\PDF-Over.exe\",0
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\PDF-Over.exe\shell\open\command]   REG_SZ   ""                "C:\Path\To\PDF-Over.exe\" "%1"
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\PDF-Over.exe\SupportedTypes]       REG_SZ   .pdf              ""
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\PDF-Over.pdf]                                   REG_SZ   ""                PDF-Over
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\PDF-Over.pdf\DefaultIcon]                       REG_SZ   ""                "C:\Path\To\PDF-Over.exe\",0
      [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\PDF-Over.pdf\shell\open\command]                REG_SZ   ""                "C:\Path\To\PDF-Over.exe\" "%1"
      
  **at last:**
  - click "Build" in the toolbar, this produces pdf-over/installer/windows/PDF-Over-SetupFiles/PDF-Over.msi
  - rename this to PDF-Over-{version}.msi; you are done
---
**MAC-SPECIFIC RELEASE PROCESS**

(must be done on a Mac VM)

**step 0: make new working directory:**
  ```mkdir /tmp/pdfover-packaging```

**step 1: unpack archive bundle:**
  ```unzip pdf-over_mac-x86_64.zip -d /tmp/pdfover-packaging```
  - if you want to open this folder, use cmd+shift+g (the "go to" dialog)
  - set necessary files to be executable:

    ```cd /tmp/pdfover-packaging/```

    ```chmod +x *.sh jre/bin/*```
  - check if it runs:

    ```./pdf-over_mac.sh```
       (if you need to give permissions to java, navigate there in finder, then right click open to reveal the "OK" button)
  - fix codesign mess:
```(run ./sign-jni.sh)```

**step 2: use platypus to create a bundle app**
  - open platypus
  - set Script Path "/tmp/pdfover-packaging/pdf-over_mac.sh"
  - set App Name "PDF-Over"
  - set Interface "None" and disable "Remain running after execution" (for debugging, it can be useful to set this to "Text Window", and enable "Remain running after execution")
  - set Icon
    - Select .icns File
    - /tmp/pdfover-packaging/icons/icon.icns
  - set Identifier "at.a-sit.PDF-Over"
  - set Author "A-SIT"
  - set Version to current version
  - check "Accepts dropped items", click Settings
    - check "Accept dropped files"
    - adjust UTIs to have only "com.adobe.pdf"
  - add "jre", "lib" and "icons" (from /tmp/pdfover-packaging) to "Bundled Files"
  - click "Create App", this creates a new .app
  - save it as /tmp/pdfover-packaging/PDF-Over.app
  - check if it runs (double-click the app in Finder)

**step 3: sign the platypus bundle**
  - run ```./signscript.sh PDF-Over.app```

**step 4: prepare disk image**
  - open disk utility
  - click file (at the top of your screen!), new image, blank image
    - name "PDF-Over", image format "Sparse Bundle Disk Image", size 250MB
    - save as /tmp/pdfover-packaging/pdf-over.sparsebundle
  - this has automatically mounted the bundle as a disk (in finder sidebar)
  - drag the following into this bundle:
    - the signed PDF-Over bundle from step 3
    - a shortcut to the Applications folder
    - background.png
  - move background.png to an invisible folder
    - Terminal: ```cd /Volumes/PDF-Over && mkdir .background && mv background.png .background```
  - switch to the "PDF-Over" volume in Finder
  - switch Finder to icon view (if it isn't yet - it's the button to the right of the current folder name)
  - in Finder, click "View" (at the top), "Show View Options", enable "Always open in icon view" and "Browse in icon view"
  - set Background to "Picture", click to select, cmd+shift+g into /Volumes/PDF-Over/.background, and select background.png
  - enable "sort -> snap to grid", adjust icon size & grid spacing until it looks centered
    - icon size 48x48, grid size slightly below maximum tends to give good results

**step 5: bundle & notarize disk image**
  - unmount the "PDF-Over" volume if it is still mounted
  - in Disk Utility, go to (at the top) Images, Convert
    - select /tmp/pdfover-packaging/pdf-over.sparsebundle from step 4 as input
    - set Image Format to "Compressed"
    - save as /tmp/pdfover-packaging/PDF-Over-{version}.dmg
  - mount it, verify that it looks good, then unmount it
  - submit the bundle to app for notarization
    - the first time, you will need to set your username & password
    - run ```./notarizeAppCommand.sh PDF-Over-{version}.dmg```
    - wait until notarization succeeds (usually <15min)
    - if an error occurs, you can check the log with ```./checkNotaryLog.sh {uuid}```
  - bundle the notarization ticket with the .dmg: 
    ```xcrun stapler staple PDF-Over-{version}.dmg```
  - you are done, this is the official mac release bundle!
